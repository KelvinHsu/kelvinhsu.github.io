I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics at **TU Wien**, working under the supervision of [**Máté Gerencsér**]().
My main research interests lie in **stochastic analysis**, more specifically in **singular SPDEs** as well as its applications in mathematical physics, in particular **random Schrödinger operators**.

Before coming to Vienna, I completed my doctorate degree at CEREMADE, Paris-Dauphine University (part of the PSL University), under the supervision of [**Cyril Labbé**](). My thesis, *On Random Schrödinger Operators in the Continuous Setting*, was defended on 27 June 2024. A copy is available [here]().

Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a student in the master's programme *Probabilités et Modèles Aléatoires* at Sorbonne University (Paris-VI). I also hold a double Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University, awarded in 2018.

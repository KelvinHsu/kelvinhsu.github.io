I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics at **TU Wien**, working under the supervision of **Máté Gerencsér**.
My main research interests lie in **stochastic analysis**, more specifically in **singular SPDEs** as well as its applications in mathematical physics, in particular **random Schrödinger operators**.

Before coming to Vienna, I obtained my doctorate degree at CEREMADE, Paris-Dauphine University - PSL, under the supervision of **Cyril Labbé**. You can find a copy of my thesis *here*, defended on 27 June 2024.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a student of the master programme Probailités et Modèles Aléatoires at Sorbonne University (Paris-VI). I hold also a double Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering from the National Taiwan University, awarded in 2018.

We present a simple construction of a random Schrödinger operator subject to a magnetic field with a regularity as low as 0−-Hölder and a Gaussian white noise electric potential on a two-dimensional bounded box. This construction is based on the exponential Ansatz introduced in [HL15] and leverages the semigroup approach developed in [HL24]. The proposed construction enables us to generalise an asymptotic result for the bottom of the spectrum of the two-dimensional continuous Anderson Hamiltonian, first proved in [CvZ21], to the magnetic case. Our choice of potential not only covers the case of a uniform magnetic field, but also those which would break translational invariance.
